# Quote and reply to messages on Discord!
Quote is a Discord bot that allows users to easily quote messages, a feature that any serious messaging platform should have but is missing from Discord.

![Here is how it looks](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/154295458531901441/526119544947736595/unknown.png)

# Features

## Quoting 

* You can quote messages by reacting with ðŸ’¬ (`:speech_balloon:`) to them (this feature needs to be enabled first by using the `>reactions` command).


* You can quote messages from any channel by using the `>quote` command, like this: `>quote 507103646995972096 My Optional Reply`, where the number is the ID of the message you want to quote.

  * To get message IDs you need to enable Developer Mode in Discord >settings >Appearance >Developer Mode, and right click on a message >Copy ID.

* The footer contains useful information on the requester, channel of the original message and timestamp of the original message.


* The Original Poster name in the quote is actually a clickable link to the original message.


* The bot supports quoting of regular messages sent either by users or other bots, but also supports quoting messages containing single or multiple files attachments.

  * If the original message has a single image as an attachment Quote will automatically embed it.


## Delete Commands
* You can set the bot to automatically delete the commands used to quote messages. Type `>delcommands` to activate the option server wide.


## Random Quotes
* Get a random quote from a random (or specified) category. You can also submit your own quotes for someone else to randomize in the future.


## Pinning
* You can define a pin channel by running the command `>pinchannel #myChannel`, and have the bot embed there any message to which you add a ðŸ“Œ (`:pushpin:`) reaction to. (Only users with Manage Messages permission can use this to avoid spam.)


## Snipe
* Never seen an unread message notification in a channel to then find nothing there? Quote will allow users with Manage Messages permission to check the last deleted message in a channel.
  * Use the command `>snipe` to show last deleted message in the current channel.
  * Add a channel identifier `>snipe #myChannel` to see last deleted message in #myChannel.


## Custom Prefix
* Don't like `>` as your server's prefix? You can change it by using `>prefix <your custom prefix>` eg: `>prefix !`.


## Help
* The bot comes with a `>help` function that shows the list of all available commands. 
* You can type `>help <exampleCommand>` to see more information about each command. 


## Anti-Bot Farm
* Quote will leave any server with more than 20 members that has more than 70% of the population composed of Bots.


## Other
* All of ther useful features that you'll love. We're still improving, so give us a chance.
