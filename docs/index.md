# Quote and reply to messages on Discord!
Quote is a Discord bot that allows users to easily quote messages, a feature that any serious messaging platform should have but is missing from Discord.

---

## Features
Reaction Quoting: React to a message with ðŸ’¬ (`:speech_balloon:`). This is toggled with the command `>reactions`. (Requires `Manage Server` permission.)

Link Quoting: Copy a direct link to a message, and paste it in chat and Quote will automatically embed the linked message.

Command Quoting: You can quote by using the `>quote` command.

Message Sniping: Check the last deleted messages by using the command `>snipe`.
