### More

* The footer contains useful information on the requester, channel of the original message and timestamp of the original message.

* The `Original Poster` name in the quote is actually a clickable link to the original message.

* The bot supports quoting of regular messages sent either by users or other bots, but also supports quoting messages containing single or multiple files attachments.
  * If the original message has a single image as an attachment Quote will automatically embed it.
